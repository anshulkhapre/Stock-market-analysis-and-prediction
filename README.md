# Stock-market-analysis-and-prediction

# Introduction

Stock Market Analysis and Prediction is a project that uses Google Finance data to do technical analysis, visualisation, and prediction. By examining data from the stock market, notably from some of the world's largest technological companies and others. I used pandas to obtain stock data, displayed several elements of it, and then looked at a few different approaches to analyse a stock's risk based on its past performance history. Using the Monte Carlo approach, I predicted future stock values!

# Aim

The goal of this project is to compare the performance of prediction algorithms on stock market data and get a broad understanding of this data through visualisation in order to forecast future stock behaviour and risk value for each stock. Data mining and statistics are both used in this research. NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization Libraries like Seaborn are heavily used in this project.

# Conclusion

Finally, the Stock Market Analysis wasp does a good job of analysing the data and can anticipate the stock market with a precision of around 70%. It may be used by a variety of individuals and businesses to forecast the value of their stock, among other things. More data may be collected to achieve greater efficiency. This will necessitate strong data mining and data visualisation abilities. Finally, we can conclude that this project has room for development, and that the existing effort is sufficient to do the entire analysis with predictions in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the current and prospective stock market.
